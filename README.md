# invisible-tech-server

This application has both the client and server sides. The client side is built with react and it consumes the api as created on the server side. It can be found [Here](https://github.com/bamoha/invisible-tech-client) 
I use Axios to get the data and display. I also chose some warm colors to go with it.



## To run the server

Change the working directory to server and run

<code>
  npm install
  npm start
</code>

## To run the Client

Revert to the client repo [Here](https://github.com/bamoha/invisible-tech-client), pull it and run

<code>
  npm install
  npm start
</code>
